# congressional-portal-project

The congressional-portal-project provides a repository for workflows, methodologies, instructional materials, controlled vocabularies, and more. This repository was created to house large-scale project efficiency methodologies, automated workflows, and to document strategies throughout the project timeline.  The project scope focuses on materials relating to the American Congress from the [Carl Albert Research and Studies Center Archives](https://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter/congressional-collection). Specific content information can be reviewed below.

## december 2023 updates

We are pleased to announce the successful **rollout of our latest application and model**, which has significantly enhanced our capabilities in text interpretation, metadata collection, sentiment analysis, tone recognition, and other forms of data extraction from archival text and photographs.

**Previous methodology:** Students working 10-15 hours per week were able to scan and collect metadata for an avergae of 55 documents per week. 

**Document Processing:** Our new model has processed and collected data from a remarkable ***12,537 pages*** of archival materials, comprising typewritten and handwritten content.

**Metadata Collection:** In addition, we have successfully described and collected metadata for ***800 scanned photograph*** images.

**Error Resolution:** We identified and addressed ***150 errors*** related to misspelled months, such as "Vay" instead of "May" and "Mary" instead of "March." We have promptly resolved this issue, ensuring accurate data handling moving forward.

## folders:
  * [**documentation-applications-list**](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main/documentation-applications-lists) contains project worksheets, collection indexes, training models, and controlled vocabularies.
  * [**workflows**](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main/workflows) contains packaged workflows with either executable portable applications or consolidated/compiled scripts for OCRing, assigning controlled metadata, extracting specific text from OCR text.  
  * [**python scripts and notes**](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main/scripts-notes) contains each individual script with corresponding notes to explain the script, the packages needed to make the package work, and steps for implementation. 

## tasks simplified

* **handwritten documents** - the focus is on transcribing hard to read text, and collecting required metadata, quickly and efficiently
* **conbination of handwritten and typewritten documents** - developing automated processes to read both handwritten and typewritten documents
* **face recognition** - bulk processing recognition of faces in images with trained models, scripts, and lists
* **transcribing A/V** - bulk transcription and extraction of audio/visual text greatly enhances workflow 
* **transcribing A/V - topic modeling** - bulk transcription of audio/visual materials combined with adcanced topic identification increases productivity, accuracy, and efficiency
* **migration and finding aid tranforms** - bulk processing for finding aid transforms involve creating or updating descriptive metadata and finding aids for archival collections
* **quality control and error checking** - reviews and verifys the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of digitized and transcribed materials resulting from the above tasks


## content overview
