Summary of the Code:

The provided code is a Python script that performs text extraction and analysis on documents stored in an Amazon S3 bucket using Amazon Textract and various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The script retrieves the text content from each document, performs NLP analysis, and then saves the extracted data to an Excel file.

Import Libraries: The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including boto3 for AWS interactions, time for timing control, pandas for data manipulation, TextBlob for NLP analysis, nltk for natural language processing, and tqdm for displaying a progress bar.

User Input: The user is prompted to provide the path to a credentials.txt file that contains AWS access credentials and the S3 bucket name.

Reading Credentials: The script reads the AWS credentials (access key ID, secret access key) and S3 bucket name from the credentials.txt file.

AWS Configuration: The AWS region is set, the Amazon Textract client and S3 client are initialized using the provided credentials and region.

NLTK Initialization: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is initialized by downloading necessary resources like tokenizers, stop words, and part-of-speech taggers.

US States List: A list of US state names is defined.

Retrieve Objects: The script retrieves the list of objects from the specified S3 bucket.

Processing Objects: For each object in the bucket, the script performs the following steps:

Initiates document text detection using Amazon Textract.
Polls for the completion of the document analysis job and waits if necessary.
If the analysis job succeeds, the text content is extracted from the blocks.
The extracted text is tokenized into words and sentences.
Using TextBlob, NLP analysis is performed to extract dates, proper names/entities, and US states.
Extracted data is transformed into comma-separated strings and appended to the data list.
Error Handling: If any error occurs during the processing of an object, it is printed to the console, and the loop continues to the next object.

Progress Bar: A progress bar is displayed using tqdm to show the progress of object processing.

Data Conversion and Saving: After processing all objects, the script creates a pandas DataFrame from the collected data. The DataFrame is then saved to an Excel file named text_data.xlsx.

Instructions:

Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including boto3, pandas, textblob, nltk, and tqdm.

Create a credentials.txt file and populate it with your AWS access key ID, secret access key, and S3 bucket name.

Update the aws_region variable to match your desired AWS region.

If needed, modify the us_states_list to include or exclude specific US state names.

Run the script. It will prompt you to enter the path to the credentials.txt file.

The script will process each object in the specified S3 bucket, extract text, perform NLP analysis, and save the results to an Excel file named text_data.xlsx.

Monitor the progress using the displayed progress bar.

If any errors occur during processing, they will be printed to the console.

Once the processing is complete, the script will indicate that the text data has been saved to the Excel file.

Note: If you encounter any issues related to AWS access, permissions, or S3 objects, ensure that you have provided correct credentials, object keys, and region, and that your AWS account has the necessary permissions for S3 and Textract operations.
