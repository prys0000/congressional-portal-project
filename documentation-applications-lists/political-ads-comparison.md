# political ads updates using NEH-AI-CAC workflow

The Center, as part of the NEH Congressional Portal project, has included collection of 21,476 individual political ads from the United States House of Representatives, spanning 1962 to 2016 and covering all 50 states.

Note the summaries and subjects from legacy information compared to the NEH project transformation package ${\color{green}garyViii.py}$ :

![summary-subject](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/blob/d6dc97219882b8a1e047af4901e88aafb0a57ae7/documentation-applications-lists/av2.jpg)

Note the yellow highlighted columns with newly generated data from NEH transformation package  ${\color{green}garyViii.py}$ :

### advantages
With over 21,000 individual files, complex analysis and metadata collection packges increase productivity, standardize terminology, and allows for complex interpretation of moving images and audio. Sentiment analysis, automated matching of standardized political science identification codes, and extraction of additional data for file migration and long-term discoverability improves quality of archival processing which also enhances file preservation and stability.
