# **Student Workflow for Digitization Process**

The following workflow guides students through the process of preparing, scanning, and recording metadata of archival materials.

## Step 1: Open Controlled Metadata Worksheet and Finding Aid Worksheet


* The main folder for the project is located on OneDrive: NEH-Congressional Portal (CAC Students will have assigned folders with links)
* Open the ***Controlled Metadata Worksheet***: This worksheet contains the controlled vocabulary and terms that should be used when recording metadata.
* Open the ***Collection Finding Aid Worksheet***: This worksheet contains information about the archival collection, including folder-level identification. It has been assigned to you and includes the series or folder that has the materials you need to work on.
* Open the ***AS-CAC Import Template***: this is a pre-designed metadata template with structure that cannot be altered. All metadata collected will reside in this file.
    * Each field has an explanation or definition to aid in collection.
    * Controlled data fields will have **dropdown boxes** that you must choose an entry from. 
* If there are existing digital files scanned without collected metadata (see your assignment packet) open the ***Collection Scans*** folder.

## Step 2: Locate Collection in the Archival Repository 

* Use the [ArchivesSpace](https://arc.ou.edu/) Finding Aid to locate the collection. ArchivesSpace is an archival collection management application that provides information on the collection's location, arrangement, and contents.
* Find the series or folder that has the materials assigned to you.

## Step 3: Pull Boxes from Archival Storage

* With approval from the Archivist or Supervisor, access the 'Stacks'.
* Carefully pull the boxes containing the materials assigned to you from the archival storage area. Make sure to handle the materials with care to avoid any damage.

## Step 4: Prepare Documents for Scanning

* Remove all staples, paperclips, plastic clips or any metal from the documents

* Keep the original order of the documents and DO NOT move the placement (keep order)

* Make sure the folder is in good condition. If it is not, then start a new folder and copy the information on the old folder to the new folder.

* If there are too many documents in one folder alert an archivist to assist in dividing the folder

* Dust of the pages if there are debris or other deposits

* Double check the pages for printing on one or both sides (document two-sided in the notes)


## Step 5: Scan Materials
* Review the ***Scanning Guide*** located in your OneDrive folder. 
* Follow the Digitization Guidelines provided below to scan the materials:

**Digitization Guidelines**
The following standards are informed by the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) and the Library of Congress Recommended Formats Statement.


| Material Type | Resolution | Color | File Format | Min. Bit Depth |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Textual | Minimum 400 dpi; 600 preferred | Color preferred to grayscale | Uncompressed TIFF | 24 |
| Visual (e.g., photographic, artwork, maps, cartoons, posters) | Minimum 600 dpi | Color preferred to grayscale | Uncompressed TIFF | 24 |
| Audio | 44.1 kHz/16 bit or higher | MP3@192 kbps | n/a | Uncompressed WAV or MP3 (access copy) |
| Video | 10 bit | n/a | Uncompressed MOV Or MPEG-4 OR MP4 (access copy) | n/a |


## Step 6: Collect Metadata
* Record the metadata of the materials scanned according to the Controlled Metadata Worksheet. Review the ***Recording Metadata Guide*** located in your OneDrive folder. 
* Ensure that the metadata is recorded accurately and consistently using the [**controlled vocabulary**](https://github.com/prys0000/political-commercial-collection-archives/blob/f89d80f02de2cf68aad494918a72e00c9b7495f7/controlled-vocab-datasets-models/Controlled%20Vocabs_Lists.xlsx) provided - this is also located in your OneDrive folder.
* The primary purposes of description in archival, manuscript, and environments are to identify, authenticate, contextualize, preserve, and make the items discoverable.
* The focus is on context and content.
* Be sure to gather all names, events, or related information to help discoverability.
* Spell out acronyms (example: Oklahoma Historical Society (OHS))
* If there are questions, ask the Archivist.

## Step 7: Run Spellchecker/Cleanup Tool
* Double click the [Spelling/grammar checking application](https://github.com/prys0000/political-commercial-collection-archives/blob/main/practice/radio%20documents/qc-1-neh.py), point to the metadata worksheet and click 'OK'.
    * This will check all of the spelling, grammar, controlled vocabulary, etc...and save a clean worksheet in the same location as 'Cleaned-output.xlsx'. 

## Step 8: Save Metadata in Archival Metadata Worksheet Template
* Save the collected metadata in the worksheet template. This template is structured to record all the necessary metadata information for the archival materials.

## Step 9: Return Materials to Archival Storage
* Carefully return the materials to their appropriate boxes and place them back in the archival storage area.

***Note: Always handle archival materials with care and respect the guidelines and instructions provided by the archival institution and project supervisor.***
