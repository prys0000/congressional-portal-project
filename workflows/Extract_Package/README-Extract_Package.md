## Extract_Package

* This folder contains a script that was designed to read text, filter common words/phrases, assign pre-defined text, check spelling and grammar and save metadata to a structured excel file for easy manipulation of data.
* Please note that the script requires you enter your own paths, models, and engines relative to your institution.
* I have provided (non exhausted but great start) dictionaries and lists to get you started!
