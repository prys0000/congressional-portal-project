## Step 4: Load Digital Files into Preservica
* The archival objects are now ready in ***ArchivesSpace*** to add Digital files via [***Preservica***](https://oucac.access.preservica.com/).
* Navigate to the assigned collection folder and download the files to the Oklahoma folder on your PC (if you cannot locate the folder, notify an Archivist).
* Create the folder hiearchy that matches your files:
    * **Example – James R. Jones Collection** [Folder]
        * **Campaign, 1970-1986** [Folder]
        * **Campaign ‘76 – Constituent Letters** [Folder]
            * **Item** [Digital File]
            * **Item** [Digital File]
            * **Item** [Digital File]
* Open the ***‘credentials.properties’*** file. 
* Copy the path to the new files to upload (***example-*** "C:\Oklahoma\James R. JonesCollection“) into the ## Network drive where data lives ***data.folder=*** C:\Oklahoma\James R. JonesCollection.
* Click save.
* Double click ***‘main.py’***.
* The script will run and upload the digital files to the ArchivesSpace archival objects and create digital files in ArchivesSpace.

**Once this process is complete, check both platforms for errors**
