# **Student Workflow for Digitization Process**

The following workflow guides students through the process of preparing, scanning, and recording metadata of archival materials.

## Step 1: Open Controlled Metadata Worksheet and Finding Aid Worksheet

Creation of the controlled lists has been a comprehensive collection of legacy terminology, political science terminology, standardized common terms, controlled subject and political science policy guides, and standardized data management concepts. 

* Open the Controlled Metadata Worksheet: This worksheet contains the controlled vocabulary and terms that should be used when recording metadata.
* Open the Finding Aid Worksheet: This worksheet contains information about the archival collection, including folder-level identification. It has been assigned to you and includes the series or folder that has the materials you need to work on.

## Step 2: Locate Collection in the Archival Repository 

* Use the [ArchivesSpace](https://arc.ou.edu/) Finding Aid to locate the collection. ArchivesSpace is an archival collection management application that provides information on the collection's location, arrangement, and contents.
* Find the series or folder that has the materials assigned to you.

## Step 3: Pull Boxes from Archival Storage

* Carefully pull the boxes containing the materials assigned to you from the archival storage area. Make sure to handle the materials with care to avoid any damage.

## Step 4: Prepare Documents for Scanning

* Re-house the materials if necessary. Ensure that the documents are in the correct order, and remove any staples, paper clips, or other fasteners that may damage the materials during the scanning process.
* Dust or clean up the materials if needed. Make sure the materials are clean and free of dust before scanning.

## Step 5: Scan Materials
* Follow the Digitization Guidelines provided below to scan the materials:

**Digitization Guidelines**
The following standards are informed by the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) and the Library of Congress Recommended Formats Statement.


| Material Type | Resolution | Color | File Format | Min. Bit Depth |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Textual | Minimum 400 dpi; 600 preferred | Color preferred to grayscale | Uncompressed TIFF | 24 |
| Visual (e.g., photographic, artwork, maps, cartoons, posters) | Minimum 600 dpi | Color preferred to grayscale | Uncompressed TIFF | 24 |
| Audio | 44.1 kHz/16 bit or higher | MP3@192 kbps | n/a | Uncompressed WAV or MP3 (access copy) |
| Video | 10 bit | n/a | Uncompressed MOV Or MPEG-4 OR MP4 (access copy) | n/a |


## Step 6: Collect Metadata
* Record the metadata of the materials scanned according to the Controlled Metadata Worksheet.
* Ensure that the metadata is recorded accurately and consistently using the controlled vocabulary provided.

## Step 7: Save Metadata in Archival Metadata Worksheet Template
* Save the collected metadata in the worksheet template. This template is structured to record all the necessary metadata information for the archival materials.

## Step 8: Return Materials to Archival Storage
* Carefully return the materials to their appropriate boxes and place them back in the archival storage area.

***Note: Always handle archival materials with care and respect the guidelines and instructions provided by the archival institution and project supervisor.***
