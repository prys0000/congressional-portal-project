## about the project

The American Congress Digital Archives Portal is a collaborative, non-partisan project that makes congressional archives available online, bringing the history of the People’s Branch to the people. 

Our task at the Carl Albert Center Archives is to:
  * Scan curated collection materials 
  * Collect metadata
  * Provide this information to our partners

The Center will concentrate on content related to four curated collections, encompassing over 75,677 individual items from the listed collections:
