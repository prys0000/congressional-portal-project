OCR Script Summary

Libraries Used:
os: Manage file paths and directory operations.
Pillow (PIL): Handle and process images.
pytesseract: A Python binding for Tesseract-OCR Engine to extract text from images.
pdf2image: Convert PDF files into images.
sys: System-specific parameters and functions.

Basic Configuration:
Locate the directory of the currently running script or executable.
Set paths for external tools required, such as poppler (needed to convert PDF to images) and Tesseract-OCR (for performing OCR).

Image Preprocessing:
The script resizes the image to improve resolution.
Converts images to grayscale to simplify data.
Enhances contrast to make text more distinguishable.
Binarizes the image to create clear distinctions between text and background.
Reduces noise for a cleaner image to optimize OCR.

PDF Conversion to Images:
The script converts each page of a given PDF into individual images using the pdf2image library.

Performing OCR:
The preprocessed images are passed through Tesseract's OCR engine to extract textual data.

Main Execution:
The user is prompted to provide paths to the folder containing PDFs and the output folder for the extracted text.
For every PDF in the given directory, the script processes it through the described steps and writes the OCR results to a .txt file in the output directory.

If the specified PDF folder doesn't exist, an error message is displayed and the script exits.
Upon successful processing, the script confirms completion with a "Done OCR for all PDFs!" message.
In essence, the script automates the process of converting PDFs to text using OCR by handling the tasks of image preprocessing, PDF conversion to images, and text extraction.
